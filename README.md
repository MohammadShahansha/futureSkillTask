## 1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?

### solution:

To implement shared functionality across a component tree in react, we can use several approaches depending on the nature and scope of the functionality.

Such: Context API, Custom Hook, Redux etc.

However, for larger projects I use Redux and for smaller projects the Context API.

## 2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?

### solution:

The `useState` hook is highly appropriate for handling state in complex components due to its simplicity, encapsulation of logic, and efficient integration with React's rendering process. It allows developers to manage local state in a clear and predictable manner, which is essential when dealing with complex component logic.

# Frontend Explaination:

I used npm package. To locally run the project need to comman `npm run dev`. Here I used JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI etc.

# Backend Explaination:

Here I also used npm package. To locally run the projects backend need to command `npm run dev` and for production need to `npm run start:prod`. Here I used moduler pattern with TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose with MongoDB etc.

However, I created the backend card data manually using Postman. Then I fatched it in front-end. As my final year semester exams are going on, I wanted to crate card from front end usin a modal.
